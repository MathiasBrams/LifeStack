Mobile app made in Flutter/Dart with Google Firebase. Has social sign-up.

The idea is you can choose several habits you want to improve. Once you have chosen them, then you can track how many times you have completed a task such as "Meditation".

When you click a task (designed to resemble a "brick" on the mainpage), then the brick animates off the top of the screen and then it gets placed in the wall with the corresponding color, fx green for "Sports" category.

Also has other visualizations of tasks completed, motivational quotes, etc.
